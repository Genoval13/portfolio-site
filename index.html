        <h4>Who is Bryan Anderson?</h4>
        <p>I am a hardcore gamer, lover of fantasy and sci-fi novels, and, of course, a full stack software engineer. I love cats (and dogs to a lesser extent), good food, and having a drink or two with friends. But mostly I just game when I have the free time for it.</p>

        <h4>What can I do?</h4>
        <p>My JavaScript skills are sharp and honed, though I know there's always room to improve and learn more. I've recently built full stack applications using Node.js and PostgreSQL for the back end and React or Angular for the front end. The list of technologies I've had experience with are diverse: Express, Knex.js, Three.js, Jest, AWS, Heroku, and more! I also have a conversational understanding of the Agile workflow and have done several applications using the principles of Test Driven Development. All after only six months of training!</p>

      <p class="projectText">This was my first successful full stack application. I tried to combine my love of well made cocktails with my desire to learn more about handling the backend of a project, so I made an app that lets you search for your favorite drink recipes and post your own. Ideally there was going to be a user login system as well, but that stretched just a little beyond me back when I made this. I also learned what a pain database design patterns can be when I realized I couldn't easily make one Post request to multiple tables. Luckily Knex is forgiving enough for me to go back and rework it someday.</p>

      <p class="projectText">Ah, my first major project at Galvanize. This one is purely front end, and we were allowed to do pretty whatever we liked for it. I chose to go with what I knew and was really into at the time: space. Which just led down the rabbit hole of Three.js, an awesome yet difficult to use JavaScript library for rendering 3D images. I spent 50+ hours on this bad boy in one week, but unfortunately I couldn't finish without getting into some crazy mathmatical calculations and raytracing, which went so far beyond the scope of the project that I decided it wasn't worth less than 12 hours before the deadline.</p>

      <p class="projectText">This one was really interesting to me, since it was my first project written in another programming language. I made this admittedly simple text adventure game in the Unity engine, writing out C# scripts to dictate the game's logic. It taught me a lot about Object Oriented Programming, as well as how fortunuate I am to be working with such a high level language like JavaScript. I never did quite iron out the C# logic though, so you only get your text choices after you input your decision. It's like playing the game backwards!</p>
